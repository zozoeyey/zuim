## Description
Zoom Board is a tangible communication tool designed to make emotional engagement visible during virtual and hybrid meetings. It offers participants a subtle, non-verbal way to share how they're feeling and signal when they need support, helping teams stay more connected even when physical cues are missing.
Through a simple dial and button, users can express their current level of engagement or raise a quiet request for question without interrupting the flow of conversation. Meanwhile, an ambient LED display captures the collective atmosphere of the meeting, making it easy for both participants and observers to sense energy levels and respond accordingly.
Whether it's a one-on-one meeting, a small group discussion, or a large webinar, Zoom Board fosters a more intuitive, human-centered meeting experience‚Äîsupporting emotional awareness, lowering barriers to feedback, and creating space for every voice to be seen.
